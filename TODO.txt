Arduino Menu Library

- color enumeration at base level
- add list of output devices
+ add macros to build navRoot
+ suspension in only one function with suspension events
+ implement other fields
- dialogs and modal dialogs (static alloc)
- alerts (dynamic)
- errors (dynamic modal)
- modal just blocks the cycle.
+ use menu acceletators + auto numbering
- custom field format (date/time)
- textField?

maybe we need a super parser for text FIELD
- current parsers are at meu object level interpreting keys
- however enter and navigation keys should be handled at lower levels
- the problem is to bring down numeric parse and accelerators

=> menus should have ID's and accelerators

the problem with dirty and changed

using a dirty flag on menu item (to be clean on draw) is not consistent with multiple device draw.
using the change function to compare current value with stored one is also inconsistent with multiple devices draw

it seems that stored values (reflex) and dirty flags MUST be available for each device!
however they are on different and independent structures!

having a cross reference.. does it really worth the effort?
if not then the menu IS single output driven.
