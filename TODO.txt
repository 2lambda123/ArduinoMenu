Arduino Menu Library

+ add macros to build navRoot
+ suspension in only one function with suspension events
+ implement other fields
- dialogs and modal dialogs (static alloc)
- alerts (dynamic)
- errors (dynamic modal)
- modal just blocks the cycle.
+ use menu acceletators + auto numbering
- custom field format (date/time)
- textField?

maybe we need a super parser for text FIELD
- current parsers are at meu object level interpreting keys
- however enter and navigation keys should be handled at lower levels
- the problem is to bring down numeric parse and accelerators

=> menus should have ID's and accelerators
