# TO DO:

## actions and events

## manage free/used space

- panel->viewport

viewport design

- viewport must sit between the printers and the raw device
- they should ignore stuff outside the free viewport area
- keep track of space usage and position cursor accordingly
- should allow creation of areas (new viewports) with special definitions
- new views can be based on free area, to account for usage
- support 2D scroll
- independent of menu structure or size, but must collaborate to adjust scroll position

## tree nav

- separate the base nav
- use menu range to manage device panels

## accelerators

- optionally use a single table with actions

## redraw need check

## extra field types
