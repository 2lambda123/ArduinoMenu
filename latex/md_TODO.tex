viewport design


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item viewport must sit between the printers and the raw device
\item keep track of space usage and position cursor accordingly
\item should allow creation of areas (new viewports) with special definitions =$>$ as a composition to be transparent
\item new views can be based on free area, to account for usage
\item support 2D scroll
\item they should ignore stuff outside the free viewport area before reaching the printer
\item measuring is taken here too
\item independent of menu structure or size, but must collaborate to adjust scroll position
\item use menu range to manage device panels
\item $\ast$$\ast$=$>$$\ast$$\ast$ need font size and glyph measure A\+PI, optionally account for U\+T\+F8, already inplace a minimal measure device (text)

\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{extra field types}
